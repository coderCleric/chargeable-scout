# Chargeable Scout Launcher
Makes the scout launcher work more like how it did in the alpha version of the game. Holding the “launch scout” button will cause the scout launcher to charge, increasing how much force the scout launches 
with when the button is released. While the launcher is charging, both the charge percentage and force multiplier will be displayed.

# Settings
Minimum Launch Multiplier: The multiplier applied to the scout launch at 0% charge.
Maximum Launch Multiplier: The multiplier applied to the scout launch at 100% charge.
Seconds Until Charged: The time it takes for the scout launcher to go from 0% to 100% charge, in seconds.
Enable Scaling Pushback: If this is enabled, the force with which the player is pushed back when the scout is launched will scale with the launch multiplier.
